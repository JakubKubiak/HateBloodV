Each character exists as an FBX file as well as a prefab with a pre-mounted weapon and legacy animations set up. In the FBX heirarchy there is a weaponMount node that can be used for weapons. Bows may require fine tuning, see the hunter/assassin prefabs for examples.

The hair, eyebrow and skin colors can be adjusted by changing the color of their material. The eye color can be changed by using a different texture (present in the Global folder).

Each animation exists as an FBX file as well as an extracted animation using the Legacy animation system (for compatibility). To use an animation with the new Animator system, simply do not use the versions in the Legacy folder.
